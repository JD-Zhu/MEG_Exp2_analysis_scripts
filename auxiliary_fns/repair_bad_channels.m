% repairs bad/missing/rejected channels after ft_rejectvisual
% can also run directly on the computed erf of each subject
% 
% While ft_rejectvisual provides the option to repair channels 
% straight away after rejection (by setting cfg.keepchannel = 'repair'),
% that approach doesn't allow you to select the 'interpolation' method 
% (it uses the default 'weighted' method, which is no good for bad channels 
% that lie next to each other)
%
% This function assumes the rejected channels have been removed from 
% the channel list (data.label). This would be the case 
% if you set cfg.keepchannel = 'no' when calling ft_rejectvisual.
% The removed channels will be automatically detected in this script.
%
% @param data:       the data with missing channels to be repaired (can be indi trials or final erf)
% @param neighbours: the neighbours file created by ft_prepare_neighbours
% @param all_labels: full list of 160 labels
%
function data = repair_bad_channels(data, neighbours, all_labels)
    % reject all potentially problematic channels first,
    % so that the noise doesn't leak into the repaired channels thru interpolation
